orig:Note the FollowupTo header  On my SVR Amiga Unix box Ive got lform lmenu and lpanel for use with the curses library Guess what they provide  Unix Press ie PrenticeHall has a programmers guide for these tools referred to as the FMLI Forms Mgmt Language Interface and ETI Extended Terminal Interface now in its nd edition It is ISBN  Paraphrased from the outside back cover FMLI is a highlevel programming tool for creating menus forms and text frames ETI is a set of screen management library subroutines that promote fast development of application programs for window panel menu and form manipulation The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces screen displays for data entry and presentation It consists of a shelllike environment of the fmli program and its database files It is section F in the Unix Press manual The ETI are subroutines part of the X manual section provide support for a multiwindow capability on an ordinary ascii terminal with controls built on top of the curses library I am scanning in a color image and it looks fine on the screen When I converted it into PCXBMPGIF files so as to get it into MS Windows the colors got much lighter For example the yellows became white Any ideas

orig:About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional ie only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space To draw the object we  fit a cubic spline through the points Each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve Each spline has an equal number of segments We assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure  Take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline Use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface  Depth sort the triangles  Take each triangle in sorted order project onto a D pixmap draw and color the triangle Take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color It is the edge coloring in step  that is at the heart of the problem The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface The reasons for this are fairly complicated They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area
