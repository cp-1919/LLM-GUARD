orig: Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the costeffectiveness of this approach It may be costeffective for deerif you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is negative ie a profit because the majority of hunters pay for licences The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals which is not in fact the case You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor Generals residence has now reached plague proportions Despite the whines of the rampant animallibbers the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting Some people take satisfaction IMHO legitimate satisfaction in eating food that they have harvested themselves The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden and in general game meat is probably much freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket By cannot now be justified I guess you mean that you personally dont see any justification Finebut what makes your opinion so important Certainly the last point is correct If politicians dont see any votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the incidence of violent crime they wont do these things
