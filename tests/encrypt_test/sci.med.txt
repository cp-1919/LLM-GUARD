dest:Hello I am writing a proposal for Development and Genetics class and I have to look at the Neurofibromatosis and variable expressivity. I am curious what has already been done on this subject especially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting phenotypes. My literature search has produced many references but I want to make sure I am proposing new research. If anyone knows anything that has been recently or is being done on this subject please let me know. I would appreciate being informed. Thank you. As I understood it is natural. Is it not found in tomatoes? Anyway lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural things: peanuts onions tomatoes milk etc. Just because something is natural doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks. As for known foods taste if I am not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it why should I not use it? Saying I should not use it is like saying I should not eat spicy food because my neighbor has ulcers. People have long modified the taste of food by additives whether they be chili black pepper salt cream sauces etc. All of these things could alter the flavor of the food. Why do we bother with them? How should food be tasted? Is it not better left to the inert? Believe what you will. The mass of anecdotal evidence combined with the lack of a properly constructed scientific experiment is proving the hypothesis makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the most likely explanation for events.

dest: One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical literature to keep up with changes in medical practice. All the clamor over later resulted in the NCIs spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved many ways that a vaccine was ineffective against cancers. A physician who continued to use it when better or more effective treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack. In a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due to candidal blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Gordon Rubenfeld through email has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candidal blooms occurring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competition for Candida in the body. I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice. He deals with critical care patients where fungal infections systemic is a real problem and just because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this. I think that a pergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is Candida. Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candidal blooms in the vagina and a woman is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give her advice to use the OTC antifungal creams. Since Candida colonizes primarily in the GI tract GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use. The problem we have here is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candidal bloom. The argument is that without proof no action is warranted. Medicine has not and probably never will be practiced this way. There has always been the use of conventional wisdom. A very good example is kidney stones. Conventional wisdom was that clinical trials have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricting the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming. Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to break down the stone once it formed. Through the recent New England Journal of Medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake. The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock why does it not make sense for humans. David We are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous. If this were a standard part of medical practice as Gordon says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline.

orig:Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems First I was recently diagnosed using a UGI series as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia As I understand it the hernia is a relatively minor problem though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it The Schatzki ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty In particular if Im not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction Fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying and causes frequent discomfort My doctor wants to dilate the ring using the following procedure use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous I would like to know if anyone out there has had this or a similar procedure doneif so was it painful successful etc Also can anyone comment on safety advisability and success rate of this procedure Has it become a common procedure I am kind of leery of having such an invasivesounding procedure performed for a currently nonthreatening condition such as this especially considering the possible side effects bleeding perforation reaction to anesthesia The second issue for the past  years I have had a large number of extra heartbeats In particular during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increasea Holter monitor recently showed  PVCs in  hrs along with a few PACs Many days there are far more than this howeverfive to ten per hour All of them were isolated and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was normal It certainly doesnt feel normal In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause severe lightheadedness I am relatively young ish thin and in good health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc Im willing to accept the extra beats as normal but dont want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom The number of PVCs seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something as simple as climbing some stairs Also if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while I tend to get a couple of extra beats Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems Both seemed to develop at about the same time Thanks for any helpadvice

orig: You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end result As an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable But there is nothing objective about the process of science If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science This is where you and I disagree with Turpin In order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific research The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING Without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing No hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving or looking out the window At least not unless youve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology It depends on the quality of their THINKING It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies And it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses And Im especially offended by Russell Turpins repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes Simply avoiding mistakes doesnt get you anywhere  In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

orig:I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to db down at cps Then it falls off a cliff to dbs down from cps on This type of loss is difficult to fit I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q behind the ear aids for several weeks These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about  minutes and I couldnt compare them head to head with the Widex Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only  months ago The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids I could take a trip to Europe on the difference Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that arent quite so expensive
