orig:completed Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon If you are trying to write a game you shouldnt be using SndPlay Instead make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it It works great You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty Before it gets empty  Callbacks are very reliable I found them  reliable even under System  I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System  with the IMV documentation You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels of course you didnt get called In general if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel with the related slowdown but then when you play more than one you dont work then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel possibly the same one multiple times This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them You need to resedit the sound and remove that command then when you create your channel specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channels synth Then you can use asynch sndplays all you want Youll probably want to switch to BufferCmds since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it and the sound manager doesnt work for games remember Spectre uses it And it works great If Spectre can spare the CPU time you can too One little disclaimer There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi cant be made to work right Im not sure either way but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work  correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager
