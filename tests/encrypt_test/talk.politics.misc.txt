orig: A search for illegally held weapons IF there were any no evidence yet produced to this effect does not justify firing into a house with women and children either It also does not justify shooting first without identifying oneself the ATF and FBI have done this before so dont say they havent please or producing a warrant Guess it depends on whose story one believes huh Which others are we talking about here Sub lethal Excuse me but those people are dead Evidence So far the FBI has produced none Dont hold your breath Only a few of those being held in chains and shackles are wanted  The rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses It was not the Feds decision to make but the firefighters This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY citizen Since fire departments do answer calls that deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for not calling them Further since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other citizen And las far as I know even criminals in prison are not left to burn to death in a fire I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you The government says it so it must be so Or havent you been reading this thread well enough to notice that some of us here dont beleive their story Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires either Besides as I explained some of us here believe their distress might have been genuine Are you SO certain it wasnt There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice either before of after the initial raid And selfdefense is not murder He did not say it was deliberate Accidents do not require conspiracy theories only wanton disregard for human life The initial raid alone agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce ment procedure proves they did not mind killing people No one here is supporting Koresh We are opposing the illegal use of excessive violence by our government against our citizens That is all A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious views will destroy itself in due time It is the feds who disrupted the fabric of society in Waco not Koresh It is the feds who forced a nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel On what basis do you assume we havent Dont you really mean It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from history that I do  Militant implies acts of aggression against ones neighbors The Davidians left their neighbors alone religious heretics who left to set up such a community So what The Mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are advocating When they finally got to set up a community they left people alone So far Americans havent been put to the sword by Mormon hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith  It doesnt mean they wont either Anyway the whole purpose of a system of laws is to punish people for what they DO not what they MIGHT do Telling is not the same as forcing When the police knock at my door I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI As for Pat and friends I dont even WATCH their channel since I am an atheist So far not watching them tell me what to do hasnt gotten me killed  Right now the only people sticking guns in anyones faces is the government And they are trying very hard to run my life Or havent you noticed
