orig: Well actually most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is based on some fantasy of how it happened But thats OK I understand you have a hockey background Stats like plusminus make RBI look good OK how about a straigh answer then Heres a very simele question to which Im sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to Please answer yes or no Roger Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs AL only please For anyone else following along it is a wellknown and demonstrable fact that a teams winloss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows Its not a definite hardandfast function but there is definitely a correlation In fact as a rule of thumb if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs for every  runs fewer than Y that team B allows it will win another game So for instance if we look at the  Toronto Blue Jays we find that they scored  runs and allowed  of which Morris allowed  All other things being equal if Frank Viola with his  ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the  innings Morris threw plausible since Viola threw  for Boston the Red Jays would have allowed about  fewer runs or enough for  more wins Now that doesnt take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway which is a harder park to pitch in particularly for a lefthander than Skydome So um Roger Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis Clearly it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a  if he had been on the Jay last year but that is not the claim We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Violas as better than Morris in the sense that had Morris performed as Viola did his team would have been better off This is true but not so open that your brain falls out Mike Jones  AIX HighEnd Development  mjonesdonaldaixkingstonibmcom

orig:Was going over some videos last night Studying  and  videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting And enlightening Heres my analysis of Jose Canseco circa Sep  and Jose Canseco circa June   Hes bulked up too much Period He needs to LOSE about  pounds not gain more bulk  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED Conservatively Id say hes lost  of his bat speed and thats a HUGE amount of speed  That open stance is KILLING him Note that he acts sort of like Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is released Downing could do this without significant head movement  Canseco cant Also note that Canseco doesnt always close his stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes theyre fully closed Without a good starting point its hard to make adjustments in your swing What would I do if I were Jose Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch so that Id never have to work again Id restructure my entire swing First minimize movement before the swing Close and widen the stance and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing Hopefully this will cut down on the time I need to swing and will allow me to move the bathead more freely Second drop  pounds Cut out the weight work Third relax the wrists Will cost some power but until I can find my  stroke concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up rolling the wrists through the strike zone and hit line drives His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park If Cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems hell be out of baseball in three years If not he could still hit  HR
