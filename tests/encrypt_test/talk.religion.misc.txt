orig: Well the best thing to do is to read the book Parallel Universes by Dr Fred Wolf In essence Dr Wolf says that one interpretation of the subatomic particlewave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location When we do something to make a particle appear we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM that is going through some of the scientific community Dr Wolf and many others claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universes itthemselfs It all gets rather interesting but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my religion Dr Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current and possible future selves I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures I realize that this gets pretty bizarre but it never hurts to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves After all the more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place

orig: Sorry but yes he does by your own description Humorous this notion of an allknowing allpowerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god But all humans are sinners thus all preJesus humans should have been punished with death We arent punished with sin now of course because God has changed He required a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death Yet he does so now He has changed The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins Besides his midst is everywhere so your statement is meaningless He tolerates sin in Hell which surely is in his midst as well Also given that he is allknowing he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins as well as when and where so what does tolerance have to do with anything All of this is absolute nonsense unless your god is not indeed allknowing and allpowerful or unless he doesnt take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim Not relevant The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god The nature of his creationsvictims is not at issue I see an allknowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an allpowerful god who had no choice in the matter Mindmush Did I miss something Did you give some indication at to why a KIND and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation I note that your answer physically follows my question but I fail to discern a connection between the two By the way for what am I being consoled Why not By the way I note for the record that you didnt answer the questions Death andor eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment I hope you arent a parent This is quite an elaborate fantasy that youve constructed but sadly it lacks a basis in reality It also does not address the questions that I raised The god that you describe is not a good parent but a tyrant Sorry was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow or the god of the Koran The Vedas The Book of Koresh Oh yes its all so clear

orig: No this is far from clear We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor made this claim We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire In the absense of any more evidence I dont see how we can decide who to believe Furthermore its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else With the state of the area now we may never know what happened Again we have only the word of the FBI on this claim The lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities Its more likely that the BDs started the fire than did the FBI But there is currently NO way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence which is nearly none D The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs I am truely amazed that I have heard or read of no one suggesting this possibility With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks it had to have been chaotic inside I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over With the winds it would have quickly gotten out of control No I think that D is also quite reasonable I personally cant really asses any relative probablities to either of these  probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue I would probably take an accident either FBI or BD over intential setting of the fire I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that theyve reach any such conclusions He pointed out that under intense heat sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports Ive read and heard In short theres been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday We should remain skeptical until more information is available

orig: Dr Englands story deleted it was a nice read the first time through It isnt so much a matter of interpretation of Bible texts that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of fabrication About  years ago National Lampoon had some comic strips in them that were drawn by Neal Adams They were called Son o God comics It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible In the comic there were a group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn and when one of them said the magic word he turned into Son o God He went from a myopic curly headed yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of Jesus  with long flowing brown hair and gentile features Now if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this NatLamp Jesus we would have to say that this was fallacious since this Jesus was a fabrication and did not really exist This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim that they are Christian They profess faith in Jesus but the Jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the NatLamp Jesus was
