orig:  Request for opinions   Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch  Like most everyone else I ended up getting two different sizes for the top and bottom My top is a L and the bottom is a L For the bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the  had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs I have large muscular thighs and no I didnt use the thighmaster to get them  The jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the waist and too small in the arms I cant imagine finding a onepiece size that would have fit correctly as even the  piece has its problems strange since my VPilot jacket fits great all over and when I tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks Also even though its related to convienience you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands Ive gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit since you cant fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my sidecar rig  With the two piece I unzip the pants I generally leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belttype band real tight stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags the pants just fit and run errands just wearing the jacket Actually if I know Ill be running errands I just wear my VPilot jacket but thats just me As far as crash protection Id say that both suits are probably equal It seems that for weather protection if anything the  piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by  inches The  piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not So Id have to vote for the two piece Despite the slightly odd fit I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own Wouldnt go long distance without it Ken Wallich wallichncdcom kenwallichcom  kmwalorg  decwrlvixieamberken
