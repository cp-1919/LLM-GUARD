orig: My next project is to come up with an IFdetector module for fast    to  kBsec  packet radio use No fancy modulation scheme just  wide FSK for use at  or  MHz  Im a bit familiar with the Motorola  chip but I wonder if there  are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies  My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back  end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other Im  particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than   do any  current chips work up to say MHz with internal downconversion so a  normal IF filter can be used  Any suggestions  John What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings I built  watt FSK transceivers at  MHz They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at  MHz The receiver uses the MC which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the  Mbps  GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook The MC which includes a VHF converter section could also be used at these speeds There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this the MC if I remember rightly While using this would have let me reduce the external IF count on receive it didnt really offer all that much help on transmit so I didnt bother with it The radios I built were first designed and built for  kbps in a  MHz channel but later reduced to half that These  kbps radios actually have done quite well in acrossthebench tests at  kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design Handling the data stream is another matter entirely Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a beacon test mode While there is not yet endend twoway data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings data is perfect copy at ngn Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed the a  kbytes of the test text chapter  of Isaiah takes only a little over  of a second Ive been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time money and energy If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at  MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn overlooking Si valley The antenna is horizontally polarized I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your target If you cant arrange your paths such that you have complete lineofsight I think youll want to address the intersymbolinterference caused by multipath and probably link CN budgets if paths are very far from LOS For more details see the th CNC Im currently working on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these problems Id be glad to help as I can with any design problems  Glenn Elmore ngn
