orig: OK Doug is right it would be obstruction of justice blah blah blah BUT saying I forgot is a lie which is just as bad from a moral point of view IF you think lawfulness is a good in and of itself which admittedly most people do not But theres an even better way out of this PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally you can probably plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key The government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which may tend to incriminate that defendant Though this has never been applied in the cryptography context at least as far as I can tell it seems an obvious application to me This may be a common suggestion in this group but if its not Im new here Id love to hear what people have to say about it Since I dont really read this group and since the subject matter is more legal than cryptoid maybe misclegalcomputing would be an appropriate place Steve
